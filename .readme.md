If not already installed:
```pip install wheel```

If project is pure python and python2/3 compatible create a universal wheel:
```python setup.py bdist_wheel --universal```

Or wheels are not needed, simply:
```python setup.py bdist```

Best approach to uploading to PyPI is to use twine:
```pip install twine```

Create an account on testpypi page
API key:

```pypi-AgENdGVzdC5weXBpLm9yZwIkNWEzYWU2NzItY2U3OS00NzRiLTlmYjMtYWI2ZTkxOWVlN2RlAAIqWzMsImE2ZGI2N2Q5LTYyMzYtNGQ5MS1iOGNkLTc5Y2M4MDY1ODI3MyJdAAAGIHaDxhWk7X18BqTUoN-H-R1ker5ExBOtwNLNkuodexbm```

Upload distribution files with twine
```twine upload --repository-url https://test.pypi.org/legacy/ dist/pyexample-0.1.0.tar.gz```
Or
```twine upload --repository-url https://test.pypi.org/legacy/ dist/*```


Install storypy from test pypi
```pip install -i https://test.pypi.org/simple/ storypy==0.1.1```

To specify in installation command that dependencies should also be fetched from the main PyPI repository.
The command tells pip to look in TestPyPI for your package but check the main PyPI for any dependencies that aren't found in TestPyPI
```pip install -i https://test.pypi.org/simple/ --extra-index-url https://pypi.org/simple storypy```
