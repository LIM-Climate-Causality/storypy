If not already installed:
```pip install wheel```

If project is pure python and python2/3 compatible create a universal wheel:
```python setup.py bdist_wheel --universal```

Or wheels are not needed, simply:
```python setup.py bdist```

Best approach to uploading to PyPI is to use twine:
```pip install twine```

Create an account on testpypi page
API key:

```twine upload --repository-url https://test.pypi.org/legacy/ dist/pyexample-0.1.0.tar.gz```
Or
```twine upload --repository-url https://test.pypi.org/legacy/ dist/*```
